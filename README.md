### **Known Issues**

#### **Invalid link**
The GPT is returning an invalid link such that it is not clickable in the GPT response. This is a known issue with work-arounds. For now, the GPT returns the URL in a code snippet so that it may easily be copied and pasted into a browser address.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and interactivity.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the app.
- **ChatGPT Store**: For creating and hosting the GPT.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Handle invalid link
- Add account creation and user login system.
- Expand palettes to 5 or more colors with advanced customization options.
- Allow users to download palettes in various formats (e.g., CSS, JSON).
